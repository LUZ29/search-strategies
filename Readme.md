This project explores the connection between problem formulation and search strategies. You will need to implement and compare several search strategies on a few different puzzles and problems.

How to run
----------
* you can run this program by input in command line.

* input :
> python problemsolve.py ____.config alg (heuristic)

> alg can be:
>* dfs bfs unicost greedy iddfs deep astar idastar


> heuristic is ontional:
>* euc man

note that:
for the self-designed heuristic you don't need to input. it will automatically run in program.
the default heuristic is euc. 

for alg, the deep option just represents the deep_limited_dfs. it's for the author to check bugs. It don't have meaning, just go 100 level for each.
